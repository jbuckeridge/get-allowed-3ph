The omega, omega', omega" for each allowed transition are included in
allowed-omega.dat. The output written to standard out is in
run.out. As a very course grid was used (8x8x8), there were only 3
unique allowed transitions found. It still took 12 mins to run
however!

A plot produced using xmgrace is also included, to see how to
visualise the results. You can see that the transitions are most
likely: one aaa, two aao (a = acoustic, o = optical).
