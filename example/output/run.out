Opening mesh.yaml to read input...
Found mesh.yaml. Checking q mesh...
Mesh dimensions:   8   8   8
Reading reciprocal lattice vectors...
...done
Checking number of atoms...
Number of atoms in your system:   2
There are     3072 (q,omega) points

Reading in list of q-points and frequencies ...
WARNING: frequencies assumed to be in cm-1!!

Checking data to establish values for energy and momentum checks...
Minimum frequency in range (away from Gamma):    27.8141272 cm-1
Maximum frequency in range                  :   275.8918673 cm-1
Energy differences less than 10^-5 times this max frequency will be deemed to be zero...

Found Gamma point in list at qpt:      1
We need to set acoustic modes here to zero...
Setting the   3 lowest modes to zero at Gamma...
Now checking for imaginary modes...
Found      0 imaginary modes...
...done

Finding minimum distance between qpts...
Found minimum distance between qpts    215 and    223 of     0.2404150 A-1
Any 2 qpts where the differences between all components are less than half that
of these two will be deemed to be equal...

Now checking for allowed transitions...
Total number of allowed q  :       525312
Total number of transitions:          960
Phonon decays    :          480
Phonon collisions:          480
