Checking for unit.dat file to read in units...
Found unit.dat file - attempting to read units...
Found units of cm-1...

Opening mesh.yaml to read input...
Found mesh.yaml. Checking q mesh...
Mesh dimensions:  10  10  10
Reading reciprocal lattice vectors...
...done
Checking number of atoms...
Number of atoms in your system:   3
There are     9000 (q,omega) points

Reading in list of q-points and frequencies ...
Found temperature.dat file - attempting to read temperature...
Found temperature =    300.000000 K
JDOS will be calculated and written to file jdos.dat
NOTE: JDOS calculated here should be scaled by 1/N


Checking data to establish values for energy and momentum checks...
Minimum frequency in range (away from Gamma):    21.4194206 cm-1 
Maximum frequency in range                  :   245.1951976 cm-1 
Energy differences less than 10^-5 times this max frequency will be deemed to be zero...

Found Gamma point in list at qpt:      1
We need to set acoustic modes here to zero...
Setting the   3 lowest modes to zero at Gamma...
Now checking for imaginary modes...
...done

Finding minimum distance between qpts...
Found minimum distance between qpts    248 and    258 of     0.1827992 A-1
Any 2 qpts where the differences between all components are less than half that
of these two will be deemed to be equal...

Looking for band.yaml to read input...
Found band.yaml. Reading in data...
Number of qpts in BZ path:   1204
Reading reciprocal lattice vectors from band.yaml...
...done

Reading in BZ path q-points and frequencies ...
WARNING: frequencies assumed to be in cm-1!!
...done

Checking for Gamma point in BZ path in band.yaml...
Gamma point found in BZ list, 1st occurrence at qpt:      1
Different frequency at Gamma b/n band.yaml and mesh.yaml for mode:    6
Different frequency at Gamma b/n band.yaml and mesh.yaml for mode:    9
(I am assuming that non-analytical correction has been used!
Mesh calcs do not get the LO-TO splitting at Gamma - so we
will make the Gamma point frequencies for the mesh equal to
those of the band calculation...)

Checking for equivalent qpts between BZ list and mesh qpts...
(by comparing frequencies, watch out if you have BZ directions
that have zero dispersion for ALL bands)
Total equivalences between BZ qpts and mesh qpts:     124

Now checking for allowed transitions...
Total number of conserved q:      2002000
Total number of transitions:        11088
Phonon decays    :         5544
Phonon collisions:         5544
...done

Now writing JDOS to file (this could be a big one!)...
...done

Removing non-unique transitions from output for plotting..
Number of unique transitions to plot:      35
Number of transitions in bz plot    :       3
...done
